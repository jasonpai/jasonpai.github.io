      <p class="sub">Pragmatic and agile fullstack enterprise development.</p>
    </header>

<p>While I did mostly UI and gfx development during my studies and often stayed close to the hardware, starting my career I switched to jee based enterprise-backends. I worked in projects of various business contexts before I found my focus in ecommerce integration.</p>
<p>With the advent of robust browser programming environments I took interest in mastering the client side of things again.</p>
<p>After I managed to integrate my old rendering and eventdriven knowledge with my expertise in integration and data driven approaches, I became a fullstack developer.</p>
<p>My passion is integrating those seemingly opposite schools of thought into a great way of solving my customers requirements - finding pragmatic solutions in complex environments.</p>
